SEJITS is a framework for building small compilers embedded
domain-specific languages.

Asp is a SEJITS framework for Python.

This is a tutorial which will run in the browser and allow new
specializer developers to learn to program for Asp without installing
anything. It is designed to run in production on an Apache2 server
with the WSGI module.

Asp code is an old version from https://github.com/shoaibkamil/asp/
stripped of its specializers and will be updated to use an installed
version later. codepy and cgen are Asp dependencies, and the most
recent version as of 15 March 2012 is included here (they will also be
updated to use an installed version later). They are available from:

http://git.tiker.net/trees/codepy.git
http://git.tiker.net/trees/cgen.git 

This tutorial uses Django and is configured to use a MySQL database,
although it currently uses it for nothing. Configuration may be
required for Asp to run, see:

https://github.com/shoaibkamil/asp/wiki/Installing-required-libraries

Apache configuration is also required to run in production mode. You
can run in debug mode with the "runserver" script.
